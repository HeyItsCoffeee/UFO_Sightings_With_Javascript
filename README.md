# UFO_Sightings_With_Javascript

## Overview of the analysis:

In this project, we are improving upon an existing web page that displays information on UFO sightings. We will be implementing multiple search filters to allow users to filter the table data based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

Overall, this project will provide an improved user experience for individuals seeking to view and analyze UFO sighting data. The added search filters will allow users to more easily identify trends and patterns in the data, providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.


## Summary

Based on the analysis of the UFO sightings data, one major drawback of the current webpage is that it only allows for filtering on a limited number of criteria. While the current filters for date, city, state, country, and shape are useful, additional filters such as duration, sighting description, or weather conditions could provide more meaningful insights for users instead of providing a comment.

Two recommendations for further development of the webpage include adding a data visualization feature to allow users to easily view and compare data across multiple filters, and improving the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. Additionally, incorporating a machine learning model to predict and identify potential UFO sightings based on the data could provide a valuable tool for researchers and enthusiasts.
